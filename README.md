# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: Xiomara Quinonez

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [X] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [X] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [X] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

- add more rounds to the game
- move the buttons throughout the game

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

[JavaScript math.random() function tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random)

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

A challenge I encountered was the implementation of the JavaScript functions for both the required and optional steps. For the required steps, 
it was difficult to fully understand what each function was doing, since this involved mostly copying and pasting the code onto Glitch. I found 
that since I was not able to spend much time on the coding of these functions, as opposed to the functions in HTML and CSS, I did not fully 
understand how the JavaScript functions worked in conjunction with the functions in the other languages to get the buttons to work with the 
different audios. I found that this challenge also arose when it was time to code the optional functions. In particular, when coding the third 
optional feature, which involved generating a random secret pattern, it was initially difficult to understand how the random function would 
affect the pattern of the whole game. However, to better understand this, I began to read more about the random function and the implementation 
steps began to make sense. I also went back to the descriptions of the previous JavaScript functions to try to see the overall interconnection. 
Finding examples of how the random function can work in different ways allowed me to visualize which implementation would be most effective and 
allowed me to see different ways that this same concept could have been achieved without the random function. From this, I learned that leveraging 
outside resources is often key to understanding web development and other coding concepts. Concepts will not always make complete sense even when 
being successful with the implementation, and that is why learning to use outside resources is important to help solidify knowledge. This can be 
useful to provide proper guidance and a different perspective if another perspective does not make sense. Through this challenge, I learned to not 
give up if I ever feel like I do not understand a technical concept because there will always be outside help that can accommodate the way that I learn best. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I have questions about the implementation and design of web pages, such as this game. For example, how the different 
pages are able to work together only when they are linked together and how this is possible. I also am curious about 
the specific functions used for JavaScript, for example, how there are predetermined functions, but others have to be 
written and implemented completely. Lastly, I want to learn more about what the process of getting started with a project 
is like. Some specific ideas that I am curious about related to this include how the research begins and if there are 
specific strategies used to gather inspiration on what to place on the website. As well as, how developers choose which 
methods and features to use to accomplish their goals. For example, there may be multiple techniques that can be used to 
develop the same feature, but how does a web developer go about deciding which skills and functionality they want to 
implement to develop these features? Lastly, I want to learn about how easy it is to make changes to the website, including its format, 
once it is published. I believe having this knowledge would have been useful when completing this submission because 
it would have allowed me to determine how cautious to be with my edits before and after pushing up my work to Github, 
as well as would have opened my mind up to more ideas creatively. Overall, these ideas about web development interest 
me the most because I hope to one day be able to develop my own website related to providing educational resources to 
students and I know that having a solid understanding of how the development process works, specific to optimization 
and what can attract a user would be most useful for successfully accomplishing this goal.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had more time to work on this project, I would have done more to make this project as understandable and useful as possible to me in the future. For example, one of my main focuses would have been adding 
more comments than I already have in the project, specifying my logic in a more clear way. The reason for this is because there is always a possibility that I will get a project similar to this one in the future 
and the more specific the comments are now, then the more useful they will be in the future. So, if I had more time, I would have added more detailed comments to describe the functionality of the different files 
and how each function is working with the other to accomplish each task. Second, I would have changed the functionality of the overall project. For example, if I had the proper knowledge of the way that audio files 
can be implemented to this, I would have completed that optional prework task to be able to use a different audio file to make the game more engaging to different users. Lastly, I would have added a few different 
sets of the game to make the longevity of the game possibly longer whenever the user finishes going through all the rounds. This would have provided more versatility to the game, as well as would have made it feel 
more personal. I believe that the implementation of these ideas in the project if given the time, would be able to make the overall project more enjoyable to different users from a variety of age groups and would 
further my understanding of different web development tasks.
